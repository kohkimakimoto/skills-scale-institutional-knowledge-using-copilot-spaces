# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme employs a structured yet adaptable approach to project management designed for cross-functional teams delivering product features and services. The process is anchored by a clear lifecycle: Initiation, Planning, Execution & Tracking, Release & Deployment, and Retrospective & Continuous Improvement. Each stage relies on specific deliverables and checklists—such as project one-pagers, risk registers, backlogs with acceptance criteria, and action item templates—to ensure clarity, alignment, and repeatable outcomes. Projects begin with validation of business needs and success metrics, leveraging stakeholder alignment before moving through detailed planning, execution, and release phases, each with rigorously defined requirements and gate criteria.

## Expanded Role Definitions (Issue #4)

Core roles have been expanded to support effective collaboration and reduce process gaps (see [issue #4](https://github.com/kohkimakimoto/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/4)). The enhanced role set now includes:

**Core Delivery Roles**: Project Manager coordinates delivery activities, risk management, and team communication; Product Manager owns the product vision, backlog prioritization, and outcome measurement; Developers are responsible for implementation, testing, and technical risk mitigation; QA/Testing ensures quality through defined acceptance criteria and test plans.

**Specialized Process Roles**: Scrum Master facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes blockers, and coaches teams on practices; Release Manager coordinates release schedules, quality gates, and deployment processes; Business Analyst bridges business needs and technical solutions, gathering and validating requirements.

**Supporting Roles**: Technical Writer creates and maintains documentation for onboarding and knowledge sharing; UX/UI Designer designs interfaces and conducts user research to ensure usability and accessibility.

Each persona interacts through recurring meetings (standups, planning, retrospectives), artifacts (roadmaps, status reports), and documented processes to foster transparency and accountability. For detailed role definitions, see [OctoAcme Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

Communication within OctoAcme follows a multi-layered cadence. Weekly syncs between key leads, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalation pathways ensure information flow and prompt risk or blocker resolution. Risk management is deeply integrated, with a live risk register, defined escalation paths, and incident communication templates. All updates—including project status, decisions needed, and incident reports—are delivered through standardized documentation and single sources of truth, such as project READMEs or release docs.

Quality assurance practices span both automated and manual strategies to safeguard delivery. Each workflow includes CI pipelines for testing, linting, and security scanning, unit and integration tests for new code, and mandatory peer review before code merges. Critical paths require end-to-end smoke tests and post-release verifications. Retrospective sessions after sprints, releases, or incidents extract learnings for continuous improvement, tracking actionable items and impact measures to evolve processes iteratively and foster a culture of psychological safety and data-informed decision-making.
